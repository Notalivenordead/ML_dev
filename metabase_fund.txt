Аналитика по метро

По всему
1. Топ по загруженности - станции
SELECT 
    station_name,
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
GROUP BY 
    station_name
ORDER BY 
    total_passengers DESC
LIMIT 5;

2.  Топ по загруженности -  линии:
SELECT 
    line_name,
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
GROUP BY 
    line_name
ORDER BY 
    total_passengers DESC
LIMIT 5;

3. пассы/ветка/день
SELECT 
    line_name,
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
GROUP BY 
    line_name
ORDER BY 
    total_passengers DESC;

4. пассы/день
SELECT 
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);

По линиям

1. Топ по загруженности - станции на линии:
SELECT 
    station_name,
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    AND line_name = {{line_filter}}
GROUP BY 
    station_name
ORDER BY 
    total_passengers DESC
LIMIT 5;

2. пассы/день
SELECT 
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    AND line_name = {{line_filter}};

3.  пассы/станции
SELECT 
    station_name,
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    AND line_name = {{line_filter}}
GROUP BY 
    station_name
ORDER BY 
    total_passengers DESC;

    
По станциям

1. место в топе
WITH ranked_stations AS (
    SELECT 
        station_name,
        SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers,
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(passangers_in) DESC) AS rank
    FROM 
        metro_extended
    WHERE 
        EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    GROUP BY 
        station_name
)
SELECT 
    rank
FROM 
    ranked_stations
WHERE 
    station_name = {{station_filter}};

2. Общее число пассажиров на станции за день :

SELECT 
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    AND station_name = {{station_filter}};

3. Нужные метрики

SELECT 
    station_name,
    capacity_in AS station_capacity,
    SUM(capacity_in) OVER () AS total_capacity,
    SUM(passangers_in) AS total_passengers,
    (SUM(passangers_in)::FLOAT / capacity_in) * 100 AS load_percentage,
    SUM(SUM(passangers_in)) OVER () AS total_load
FROM 
    metro_extended
WHERE 
    EXTRACT(DAY FROM timestamp) = EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
    AND station_name = {{station_filter}}
GROUP BY 
    station_name, capacity_in;
